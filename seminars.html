                        <p><strong>Speaker 1:</strong> Dr. Eloise Moreau</p>
                        <p><strong>Title 1:</strong> Exploring Non-Commutative Structures in Distributed Systems</p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This seminar delves into the realm of non-commutative algebraic structures and their application in the modeling of distributed systems. We will discuss the implications of these structures on system performance and reliability, as well as explore novel approaches to incorporating non-commutative algebra into existing frameworks for concurrent system analysis. The talk will also include a detailed examination of case studies where these principles have been successfully applied to real-world distributed systems, highlighting the practical benefits and potential challenges.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Speaker 2:</strong> Dr. Lucien Valois</p>
                        <p><strong>Title 2:</strong> Advanced Techniques in Categorical Semantics</p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this presentation, we will explore advanced techniques in categorical semantics and their impact on the theory of computation. The talk will cover the foundational aspects of categorical semantics, including functors, natural transformations, and limits, and how these concepts can be utilized to enhance our understanding of computational models. We will also discuss recent advancements in the field, such as new categorical constructions and their applications in verifying properties of complex systems. The seminar aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research and future directions in categorical semantics.</p>

                        <p><strong>Speaker 1:</strong> Dr. Amélie Bertrand</p>
                        <p><strong>Title 1:</strong> Topological Methods in Automata Theory</p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk will focus on the application of topological methods to automata theory. We will examine how topological spaces and continuous functions can be employed to analyze and characterize the behavior of automata, with particular emphasis on the relationships between topological properties and automata state transitions. The seminar will also cover recent developments in the integration of topological concepts with automata theory and how these methods can be used to solve complex problems in theoretical computer science. Examples and case studies will be presented to illustrate the practical applications of these techniques.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Speaker 2:</strong> Dr. Xavier Lefèvre</p>
                        <p><strong>Title 2:</strong> Semantics of Concurrent Programming Languages</p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this session, we will explore the semantics of concurrent programming languages, focusing on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of different semantic models. The talk will cover various approaches to defining and analyzing the semantics of concurrent programs, including operational, denotational, and axiomatic semantics. We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and their impact on program correctness and optimization. The seminar will also include a review of recent research trends and advancements in the field of concurrent programming languages.</p>
