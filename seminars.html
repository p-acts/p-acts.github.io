                <p><strong>Title:</strong> Active Learning of Deterministic Timed Automata with Myhill-Nerode Style Characterization</p>                                
                <p class="abstract-content">
                    We present an algorithm to learn a deterministic timed automaton (DTA) via membership 
                    and equivalence queries. Our algorithm is an extension of the L* algorithm with a 
                    Myhill-Nerode style characterization of recognizable timed languages, which is the 
                    class of timed languages recognizable by DTAs. We first characterize the recognizable 
                    timed languages with a Nerode-style congruence. Using it, we give an algorithm with a 
                    smart teacher answering symbolic membership queries in addition to membership and 
                    equivalence queries. With a symbolic membership query, one can ask the membership of a 
                    certain set of timed words at one time. We prove that for any recognizable timed 
                    language, our learning algorithm returns a DTA recognizing it. We show how to answer a 
                    symbolic membership query with finitely many membership queries. We also show that our 
                    learning algorithm requires a polynomial number of queries with a smart teacher and an 
                    exponential number of queries with a normal teacher. We applied our algorithm to various 
                    benchmarks and confirmed its effectiveness with a normal teacher.

                    I will give an introduction to the purpose of the Paris ACTS seminar series and to the intersection between 
                    automata and concurrency theory at which it is situated. I will  finish by introducing a notion of specification theories that we developed some years 
                    ago and which is related to the refinement calculus of the second speaker.

                <p><strong>Title:</strong> Concurrent Refinement Algebra</p>

                <p class="abstract-content">
                  <span class="abstract-first-line">

                  <span class="full-abstract" style="display:none;">
                    Our goal is to develop a refinement calculus for shared-memory concurrent programs that 
                    supports Jones-style rely/guarantee  developments. Our semantics is based on Aczel traces, 
                    which explicitly include environment transitions as well as program transitions, and were 
                    originally proposed as a basis for showing the rely/guarantee rules of Jones are sound. 
                    Our approach has been to develop a hierarchy of algebraic theories that provide a foundation 
                    for concurrent program refinement. Our algebraic theory is based on a lattice of commands 
                    that includes a sub-lattice of test commands (similar to Kozen's Kleene Algebra with Tests) 
                    and a sub-algebra of atomic commands (similar to Milner's SCCS but with a richer structure 
                    that supports Aczel's program and environment transitions). Rely and guarantee conditions 
                    are encoded as commands within the theory, and refinement laws for deriving concurrent 
                    programs from rely/guarantee specifications can be proven within the theory.
