        <h2>About Paris ACTS</h2>

        <p>
          Paris ACTS has been created to reinforce the links between different research groups in the Paris area
          which are working on the connections between automata theory and concurrency theory,
          and in order to advance this research on a national and international level,
        </p>

        <p>
          The seminar takes place every six to eight weeks, moving between 
          <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/">LIX</a> (École Polytechnique), 
          <a href="https://www.lre.epita.fr/">LRE</a> (EPITA Paris), and 
          <a href="https://www.irif.fr/">IRIF</a> (Université Paris Cité).
          It is held in hybrid mode and is an evolution of the
	  <em><a href="https://ulifahrenberg.github.io/pomsetproject/">(i)Po(m)set Project Online Seminar</a></em> (<em>PPOS</em>).
          It is inspired by the <em><a href="https://mefosyloma.fr/">MeFoSyLoMa</a></em> seminar,
	  with which it has a slight thematic overlap, but includes a hybrid component.
        </p>

	<p>
	  The seminar has a low-traffic mailing list for announcements etc.
	  If you want to join, send an email to <a href="mailto:p-acts-owner@ml.lre.epita.fr">p-acts-owner@ml.lre.epita.fr</a>.

This talk explores the relationship between fairness and promptness in fragments of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We begin by contrasting two perspectives on LTL model checking: the <i>universal</i> problem, where all system runs must satisfy a given formula, and the <i>fair</i> problem, where almost all runs do. Although these problems share the same theoretical complexity (PSPACE-complete), interesting differences emerge when we restrict attention to certain fragments. In particular, the <i>Muller fragment</i> of LTL was previously identified as one where these two notions diverge in complexity. Extending this line of inquiry, we investigate the prompt version of LTL (pLTL), which enriches LTL with a <i>prompt eventually</i> operator ensuring liveness within bounded time. We show that the Muller fragment of pLTL behaves differently from its classical counterpart, and we identify a new expressive fragment where fair model checking can be performed more efficiently than universal model checking.

		    <i>Fatal attraction. Or: How I learned to love Continuous Petri Nets</i>

<i>Discrete</i> models of complex systems (boolean networks, Petri nets) are often used for over-approximating the set of reachable states, for example in biological networks, and to provide predictions of (at least) all possible behaviours. Of particular interest are the long-time stable subspaces, aka attractors, which give, in the context of cell regulation, exactly the phenotypes that a cell can develop. Knowing the state space sufficiently well to find attractors is thus fundamentally important.<br />

It has turned out that in our particular case, the desired over-approximation could not be obtained using boolean networks with classical update modes; a novel discrete semantics, giving most permissive Boolean networks (MPBN)s, finds reachable states previously unforeseen. The link with discrete Petri nets (and their associated analysis techniques) that existed in the classical case could not be established for MPBNs. Recent research has shown, however, that <i>continuous</i> Petri nets allow a faithful translation of MPBNs, and enjoy very nice dynamical properties supporting representing and analysing their behaviour with discrete means. Some open questions will be presented, to stimulate discussions.
