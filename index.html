        <h2>About Paris ACTS</h2>

        <p>
          Paris ACTS has been created to reinforce the links between different research groups in the Paris area
          which are working on the connections between automata theory and concurrency theory,
          and in order to advance this research on a national and international level,
        </p>

        <p>
          The seminar takes place every six to eight weeks, moving between 
          <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/">LIX</a> (École Polytechnique), 
          <a href="https://www.lre.epita.fr/">LRE</a> (EPITA Paris),
          <a href="https://www.irif.fr/">IRIF</a> (Université Paris Cité),
	  <a href="https://lmf.cnrs.fr/">LMF</a> (Université Paris-Saclay),
	  <a href="https://samovar.telecom-sudparis.eu/">SAMOVAR</a> (Télécom SudParis), and
	  <a href="https://www.lacl.fr/">LACL</a> (Université Paris Est Créteil).
          It is held in hybrid mode and has a slight thematic overlap with the <em><a href="https://mefosyloma.fr/">MeFoSyLoMa</a></em> seminar.
        </p>

	  The seminar has a low-traffic mailing list for announcements etc.

          The general program for each seminar is as follows:
          <table>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>14:00--14:45</td>
                <td>In-person talk</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>14:45--15:30</td>
                <td>Virtual or in-person talk</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>

                <td>Break</td>
              </tr>

              <p><strong>Title:</strong> Probabilistic Concurrent Systems</p>

We investigate the construction of memoryless probability measures for trace monoids, a simple probabilistic and stateless model of concurrency. Although being stateless makes obviously trace monoids poor candidates for real-life models of concurrency, it turns out that a fair amount of the specificity of mixing probability and concurrency already appears in these models. It is henceforth a valuable step toward the study of more realistic probabilistic models of concurrency to have a good understanding of memoryless probability measures for trace monoids.
The general idea is to transpose to trace monoids the standard model of coin tossing for words. As the combinatorics of trace monoids is strongly involved in this study, the Möbius polynomials of trace monoids and other related objects of linear algebra become our central objects of investigation.

              <p><strong>Title:</strong> Realizations of Relational Presheaves</p>

              <span class="toggle-abstract" style="cursor: pointer;">► <strong>Abstract:</strong></span>
              <p class="abstract-content">
		<span class="abstract-first-line">

		<span class="full-abstract" style="display:none;">
Relational presheaves generalize traditional presheaves by
going to the category of sets and relations (as opposed to sets and functions) and by allowing functors which are lax. This added generality is
useful because it intuitively allows one to encode situations where we have
representables without boundaries or with multiple boundaries at once.
In particular, the relational generalization of precubical sets has natural
application to modeling concurrency. We study categories
of relational presheaves, and construct realization functors for those. We
begin by observing that they form the category of set-based models of a
cartesian theory, which implies in particular that they are locally finitely
presentable categories. By using general results from categorical logic,
we then show that the realization of such presheaves in a cocomplete
category is a model of the theory in the opposite category, which allows
characterizing situations in which we have a realization functor. Finally,
we explain that our work has applications in the semantics of concurrency theory.
