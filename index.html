        <h2>About Paris ACTS</h2>
        <p>
          Paris ACTS has been created to reinforce the links between different research groups in the Paris area
          which are working on the connections between automata theory and concurrency theory,
          and in order to advance this research on a national and international level,
        </p>
        <p>
          The seminar takes place for an afternoon every six-eight weeks, moving between 
          <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/">LIX</a> (École Polytechnique), 
          <a href="https://www.lre.epita.fr/">LRE</a> (EPITA Paris), and 
          <a href="https://www.irif.fr/">IRIF</a> (Université Paris Cité).
          It is held in hybrid mode and is an evolution of the
	  <em><a href="https://ulifahrenberg.github.io/pomsetproject/">(i)Po(m)set Project Online Seminar</a></em> (<em>PPOS</em>).
          It is inspired by the <em><a href="https://mefosyloma.fr/">MeFoSyLoMa</a></em> seminar, with which it has a slight thematic overlap,
          but includes a hybrid component.
        </p>
	<p>
	  The seminar has a low-traffic mailing list for announcements etc.
        <p>
          The program for each afternoon is roughly as follows:
          <table>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>14:00--14:45</td>
                <td>In-person talk</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>14:45--15:30</td>
                <td>Virtual talk</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>15:30--16:00</td>
                <td>Coffee break</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>16:00--17:00</td>
                <td>Discussion</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </p>

            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Active Learning of Deterministic Timed Automata with Myhill-Nerode Style Characterization</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
	      We present an algorithm to learn a deterministic timed automaton (DTA)
	      via membership and equivalence queries. Our algorithm is an extension of
	      the L* algorithm with a Myhill-Nerode style characterization of
	      recognizable timed languages, which is the class of timed languages
	      recognizable by DTAs. We first characterize the recognizable timed
	      languages with a Nerode-style congruence. Using it, we give an algorithm
	      with a smart teacher answering symbolic membership queries in addition
	      to membership and equivalence queries. With a symbolic membership query,
	      one can ask the membership of a certain set of timed words at one
	      time. We prove that for any recognizable timed language, our learning
	      algorithm returns a DTA recognizing it. We show how to answer a symbolic
	      membership query with finitely many membership queries. We also show
	      that our learning algorithm requires a polynomial number of queries with
	      a smart teacher and an exponential number of queries with a normal
	      teacher. We applied our algorithm to various benchmarks and confirmed
	      its effectiveness with a normal teacher.
